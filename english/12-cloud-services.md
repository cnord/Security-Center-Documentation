# Cloud Services {#cloud-services}

The cloud is an infrastructure software and hardware complex. It provides services to improve the quality of services offered by the private security company.

"Alarm to Guard" is also a cloud service. This application provides fast interaction between the Security Center operator and Guard employees. Besides, it allows the Guard to get the necessary information about the site and its status.

In addition to these services, various web-interfaces are available. For example, with the help of the "Partner interface" a private security company can manage the Cloud services. It is possible to configure one of the cloud services, for example, "Alarm to Guard."

The "Engineer Interface" displays a site available for control and provides the ability to remotely control the equipment on it.

The Security Center user can select one of the modes of operation with cloud services, depending on the degree of integration with the Cloud. Full integration allows to use all cloud services. Partial means only a service that provides remote access to equipment on a site. By prohibiting transfer of any data to the Cloud, the user refuses to use all cloud services.

## Call center

### Getting Information about Site Status

The service "Get information about site status" provided by the "Call Center" allows to check the status of the protected site. This service can be enabled in the administrator panel of the partner account.

It is necessary to make sure that the site is in the expected state for various reasons. In particular, the site may not be armed due to a malfunction of the security equipment or due to a communication channel failure. When using GPRS or GSM connection, the SIM card money may run out.

To check the site status, the client of the private security company shall call the special company number. After that, he/she can independently select the service "Get information about site status" using the voice menu, enter the site number and, if necessary, a PIN code. The client of the private security company can get the PIN code in the "Personal account" of the partner, and the Security Center operator - in the "Site manager" on the "Responsible persons" tab.

![Selection of services when calling to "Call Center"][id-13-02]

The PIN code shall be requested to increase the level of security for maintaining confidential information about the site status. It is possible to enable the PIN request for calls about the status of the protected site in the control panel of the partner account.

Due to the cloud service "Call Center" the number of calls transferred to the operator is reduced. This is especially important during peak hours, when employees of enterprises come or go from work, arming or disarming sites, respectively. Automatic handling of calls to confirm arming and disarming allows the Security Center operators to performs their primary duties, namely, handling alarms.

### Panic button check

The panic button is installed in jewelry salons, pawnshops, banks, cafes, pharmacies and many other enterprises. In this case, the private security company makes a contract, which specifies the frequency of the mandatory check of the panic button by the client of the private security service: for example, once a day. 

The "Panic button check" service provided by the "Call Center" can be used to check the panic button serviceability. This service can be enabled in the administrator panel of the partner account.

To check the panic button, the client shall call the special number of the company. After that, he/she can independently select the service "Panic button check" using the voice menu, enter the site number and PIN. The client of the private security company can get the PIN code in the "Personal account" of the partner, and the Security Center operator - in the "Site manager" on the "Responsible persons" tab.

After that, the client shall press the panic button. If it works, an alarm signal is sent to the Security Center, which is automatically canceled due to the "Test" cause. In this case, the "Call Center" informs the client about the serviceability of the panic button, and the alarm log is recorded in the event log.

## Partnerâ€™s Web-Interface

The private security company can use the administrator panel to configure the cloud services after registering partner account in the Cloud.
