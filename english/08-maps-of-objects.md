# Site Maps

With the help of the "Site maps" module, it is possible to create graphical schemes describing the site: terrain map with a map of possible ways of approaching the site, site photos, floor plans, etc.

After the plan of the site premises is developed, it is possible to place a diagram of the protection coverages.

When handling an alarm it is possible to view alarm zones on site maps in the "Duty operator" module. 

There is no built-in graphic editor in the "Site maps" module, therefore it is recommended to create schemes using third-party tools. Ready images can be inserted into the map from BMP or JPG files as a background image. When preparing a background picture, select its size and resolution, taking into account the possible printing of the site map: no transformations are made, the background picture is printed in accordance with its parameters.

After the background picture is selected for the map, it is possible to place zones on it. For each zone, select the location and dimensions, as well as the way it is displayed in the active and passive state. 
After that associate the event code with the zone, the registration of which will mean the transition of the zone to the active state. Typically, this code is selected as the alarm code corresponding to the zone.

When the alarm site file is opened from the "Duty operator" module, the card containing the zone on which the alarm was received is active. Besides, the alarm zone can change visually - displayed alternately in the passive and active state.

It is also possible to specify a file for the zone. When the alarm site file is opened, the associated file will also be opened by means provided in the operating system for its file type. 
For example, if you specify a document containing important information about the site as the file, this document will be opened together with the map file.

If the Security Center software is used on the network, then the site map file shall be saved to a folder that is accessible to all users on the network. It shall be remembered that even if this folder is local for the computer where the site maps are edited, it is still necessary to use the absolute path to the folder when saving.

When saving a new site map file or saving it with a different name, the "Site map" field - its value can be viewed and changed in the "Site manager" module - is updated automatically.
